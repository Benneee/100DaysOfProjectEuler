## 100DaysOfProjectEuler


I have a few repositories already addressing my constant fight with this thing called "Problem Solving" in programming.

This time, however, I'm taking a more actionable decision than the other times and using an old friendly site called Project Euler.

Hopefully, I do this properly this time.

P.S The 100 days will have breaks in-between but I must do 100 days.

P.S.S Some years later and I still need to finish the 100 days :) I'm serious this time
